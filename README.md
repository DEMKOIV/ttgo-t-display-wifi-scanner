## Description
This is my little project based on ttgo esp32 t-display. I was exploring wifi scanning capabilities of my esp32 and its display.
### UI
The UI is pretty self explanatory:
  CH - shows what channel are you on
  APS - shows how many access points is there on a particular channel
  () - shows the quantity of all the networks regardless of the channel
  All of the network's SSIDs, dBm and encrytion (an asterisk "*") of a particular channel are shown on the display
  You can scroll through the channles using two buttons.
## Replication
If you want to replicate this project:
- Arduino IDE: just copy the code from src and paste it in Arduino IDE and upload.
- Platform.io: download all the files and open via vscode and upload it to your board

Have fun!
